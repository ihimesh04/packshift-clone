            The Company always strives to pack and move The Client's goods/ items professionally with utmost care and
            deliver on time at the most competitive price.
            <br> <br>

            mover companies PAN India.
            <br> <br>
            "The Company follows a very simple method to Bill The Client for shifting their goods/ items from one city
            to another:
            <br> <br>
            <ol>
                <li> The total number of goods/ items </li>
                <li> Types of items (fragile/ non fragile) </li>
                <li> Overall size and cubic volume occupied </li>
            </ol>
            <br> <br>
            Based on same, it is the discretion of The Company to decide whether The Client's consignment will be
            shifted exclusively in a separate vehicle or as part load in a large vehicle along with other client's
            goods/ items.
            <br> <br>
            Note : In case of shifting between 2 cities involving large distance, the shifting is always done via large
            vehicles. In case The Client's consigment consists of only few goods/ items, it is always transported as
            part load and this costs lesser as compared to an exclusive separate vehicle and is beneficial to The
            Client."

            before loading is done. "
